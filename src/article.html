            this my Will, to receive the whole of his or her share of my estate, but such child has a child or children

            his or her share of my estate, that share or the amount remaining thereof will be divided in equal shares
            amongst the surviving children of that child of mine. But if that deceased child of mine leaves no surviving

                before becoming entitled to receive the whole of their share of the residue of my estate, I leave this
